Welcome to LinTV, The Best TV for your Linux!

Here's a list of programs you need to compile & run LinTV:
 - KDE 4.2 or higher with development packages
 - If you have any Hauppage WinTV device using the ivtv driver, you need the ivtv-utils & ivtv-firmware packages.
 - you must have the latest mplayer & mencoder svn! (for the -input nodefault-bindings command)

To compile LinTV, just follow these steps:
 1. Open a terminal window  (such as the Konsole or Gnome Terminal)
 2. Change the directory to the place you extracted the LinTV sources to:

    $ cd /path/to/lintv/source

 3. Create a directory in which to build LinTV to keep the source clean:

    $ mkdir build; cd build

 4. Run cmake with the path to your KDE4 installation:

    $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`kde4-config --prefix` -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release ..
    
      OR
    
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release

 5. Run make to start building LinTV:

    $ make -j3      <-- It compiles faster with -j3 or -j<n> (n = number of CPU's) if you have more than one CPU!

 6. Install LinTV:

    # sudo or su make install

 7. Run LinTV! Enjoy!
